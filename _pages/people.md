<p style="font-size:11pt;">
  Jaemin is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the North Carolina State University. Dr. Lee received his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin and received his M.S. from Seoul National University (SNU) in Seoul, South Korea. He received his B.S. in mechanical engineering from Konkuk University in Seoul. Prior to joining the North Carolina State University faculty, he served as a postdoctoral scholar in Mechanical and Civil Engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), in Pasadena, California. In addition, he worked as a research scientist at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) in Seoul. As a visiting student at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genoa, Italy, he was awarded a fellowship from the Korea National Research Foundation.
His research interests span the area of robotics, optimal planning, whole-body control, safety-critical control, autonomy, learning-based control and hybrid dynamical systems, with a special focus on applications to loco-manipulation of legged robots or humanoids with experimental validations. His laboratory specializes in the creation of innovative robotic systems and the development of advanced planning and control algorithms with optimization and learning techniques. The overarching aim is to deploy autonomous robotic systems effectively in unstructured environments for real-world applications, leveraging AI integration.
