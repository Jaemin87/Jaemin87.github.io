<p style="font-size:13pt;">
  The objective of <b>whole-body planning and control</b> is to achieve the safe and efficient operations of intricate robotic systems that incorporate multiple points of contact, complicated constraints, and floating bases. Leveraging simplified rules and tasks derived from reduced-order models, we derive comprehensive control commands for the entire body, optimizing performance while maintaining a delicate equilibrium between safety and productivity through <b>whole-body planning and control</b> strategies. Central to our research focus is the development of comprehensive whole-body controllers, reachability-based motion planning techniques, and the implementation of safety-critical planning methodologies, addressing challenges posed by the model discrepancy between reduced-order and full-body models.

<p style="font-size:13pt;">
  <b>Loco-manipulation</b> stands as a significnatly important capability for executing intricate, human-like missions in unstructured environments and wildelife. The choice of locomotion type profoundly impacts stability, dexterity, precision, and the integration of manipulation with mobility amid physical interactions. Particularly, in dynamic levels, agile and robust locomotion becomes imperative to effectively manage reactive forces for not only locomotion but also manipulation in contacts with the environment while ensuring precise global localization. To optimize agility, stability, and accuracy in <b>loco-manipulation</b>, we employ a multifaceted approach, harnessing multiple sensors within a reactive planning and control architecture. Our goal is to delve into optimization problems that dynamically ascertain the most suitable locomotion types, thereby enhancing performance and minimizing risks during the execution of long-term <b>loco-manipulation</b> missions using legged robots. This study amalgamates model-based and data-driven methodologies, leveraging uncertain measurements from the sensors of the robotic systems.
