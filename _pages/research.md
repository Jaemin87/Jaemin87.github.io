## Whole-body Planning and Control

<p style="font-size:13pt;">
  The objective of <b>whole-body planning and control</b> is to achieve the safe and efficient operations of intricate robotic systems that incorporate multiple points of contact, complicated constraints, and floating bases. Leveraging simplified rules and tasks derived from reduced-order models, we derive comprehensive control commands for the entire body, optimizing performance while maintaining a delicate equilibrium between safety and productivity through <b>whole-body planning and control</b> strategies. Central to our research focus is the development of comprehensive whole-body controllers, reachability-based motion planning techniques, and the implementation of safety-critical planning methodologies, addressing challenges posed by the model discrepancy between reduced-order and full-body models.
