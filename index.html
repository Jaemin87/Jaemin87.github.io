The Hybrid Intelligent Experimental Robotics (HIER) Lab aims to study both theoretical and experimental research in the legged loco-manipulation of robotic systems for real-world deployment. Our goal is specifically 
1) study fundamentals to achive agile locomotion and dexterous manipulation
2) formulate planning and control framework for safety-critical autonomy
3) develop new hardware for more efficient and versatile mission completion
4) deploy learning technique to obtain adaptible solutions to challenging problem in unstructured environemtns.
