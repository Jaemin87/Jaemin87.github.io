The <b>Hybrid Intelligent Experimental Robotics (HIER) Lab</b> aims to study both theoretical and experimental research in the legged loco-manipulation of robotic systems for real-world deployment.
We focus on studying funamentals to achive agile and versitile loco-manipulation in human-robot coexistance environments and wildelife. The detiled scope of research in our group includes the following agenda. <br>
1) formulating planning and control frameworks for <b>autonomous task execution</b> <br>
2) studying <b>hybrid dynamical systems</b> in multiple contacts <br>
3) developing <b>new hardware</b> for more efficient and versatile mission completion <br>
4) deploying <b>learning technique</b> to obtain adaptible solutions to challenging problem in unstructured environemtns <br>
5) connecting <b>generative AI</b> and dynamically consistent motion primitives. <br>
