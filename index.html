The <b>Hybrid Intelligent Experimental Robotics (HIER) Lab</b> aims to study both theoretical and experimental research in the legged loco-manipulation of robotic systems for real-world deployment. We focus on <br>
1) studying <b>fundamentals</b> to achive agile locomotion and dexterous manipulation <br>
2) formulating planning and control frameworks for <b>safety-critical autonomy</b> <br>
3) developing <b>new hardware</b> for more efficient and versatile mission completion <br>
4) deploying <b>learning technique</b> to obtain adaptible solutions to challenging problem in unstructured environemtns. <br>
