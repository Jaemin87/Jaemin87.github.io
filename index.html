The Hybrid Intelligent Experimental Robotics (HIER) Lab aims to study both theoretical and experimental research in the legged loco-manipulation of robotic systems for real-world deployment. Our goal is specifically <br>
1) study fundamentals to achive agile locomotion and dexterous manipulation <br>
2) formulate planning and control framework for safety-critical autonomy <br>
3) develop new hardware for more efficient and versatile mission completion <br>
4) deploy learning technique to obtain adaptible solutions to challenging problem in unstructured environemtns. <br>
