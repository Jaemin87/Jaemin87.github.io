The <b>Hybrid Intelligent Experimental Robotics (HIER) Lab</b> aims to study both theoretical and experimental research in the legged loco-manipulation of robotic systems for real-world deployment. Our goal is specifically <br>
1) study <b>fundamentals</b> to achive agile locomotion and dexterous manipulation <br>
2) formulate planning and control frameworks for <b>safety-critical autonomy</b> <br>
3) develop <b>new hardware</b> for more efficient and versatile mission completion <br>
4) deploy <b>learning technique</b> to obtain adaptible solutions to challenging problem in unstructured environemtns. <br>
